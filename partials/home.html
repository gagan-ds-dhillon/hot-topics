            <h1>The Value of Money</h1>
				<img src="img/img-1.jpg" alt="Money">
				<p>The value of money, then, is the quantity of goods in general that will be exchanged for one unit of money. The value of money is its purchasing power, i.e., the quantity of goods and services it can purchase. What money can buy depends on the level of prices. When the price level rises, a unit of money can purchase less goods than before. Money is then said to have depreciated. Conversely, a fall in prices signifies that a unit of money can buy more than before.</p>
				<p>Money is then said to appreciate. The “general level of prices” and the value of money are thus the same thing from two opposite angles. When the prices rise the value of money falls and vice versa. In other words, the value of money and the general price level are inversely proportion­s’ to each other. Violent changes in the value of money (or the price level) disturb economic life and do great harm.<a href="https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/money/value-of-money-meaning-measurement-and-preparation-of-index-numbers/1863">www.economicsdiscussion.net/value-of-money</a></p>

				<h1>GMO food</h1>
				<img src="img/food1.jpg" alt="Food">
				<p>Genetically modified foods are foods produced from organisms that have had changes introduced into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering as opposed to traditional cross breeding. In the U.S., the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) favor the use of the term genetic engineering over genetic modification as being more precise; the USDA defines genetic modification to include "genetic engineering or other more traditional methods".</p>
				<p>Creating genetically modified food is a multi-step process. The first step is to identify a useful gene from another organism that you would like to add. The gene can be taken from a cell or artificially synthesised, and then combined with other genetic elements, including a promoter and terminator region and a selectable marker. Then the genetic elements are inserted into the targets genome. DNA is generally inserted into animal cells using microinjection, where it can be injected through the cell's nuclear envelope directly into the nucleus, or through the use of viral vectors. In plants the DNA is often inserted using Agrobacterium-mediated recombination, biolistics or electroporation. As only a single cell is transformed with genetic material, the organism must be regenerated from that single cell. In plants this is accomplished through tissue culture.In animals it is necessary to ensure that the inserted DNA is present in the embryonic stem cells. Further testing using PCR, Southern hybridization, and DNA sequencing is conducted to confirm that an organism contains the new gene.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food#:~:text=Genetically%20modified%20foods%20(GM%20foods,the%20methods%20of%20genetic%20engineering.">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food</a></p>

				<p>Increased urbanization will be one of the main ways the planet will sustain 10 billion people. There will be a lot of new cities, and mega-cities (cities with a population of over 20 million) will become more common. Possible candidates for mega-city status include: Beijing, Delhi, Jakarta, Mexico City, Mumbai, São Paulo, and Shanghai.The world will have a few hundred languages at the most.
